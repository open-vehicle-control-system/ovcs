# Changelog

## [0.7.5] (2025-01-07)
A maintenance patch, with improvements made the the README, with up to date installation
instructions from [@arcanemachine](https://github.com/arcanemachine) ([#95](https://github.com/kbrw/sweet_xml/pull/95))
and typos fixed by [@kianmeng](https://github.com/kianmeng) ([#89](https://github.com/kbrw/sweet_xml/pull/89)).

### Changed

* Warning cleanups removal made by [@VictorTrin](https://github.com/VitorTrin) and [@elfenlaid](https://github.com/elfenlaid)
([#96](https://github.com/kbrw/sweet_xml/pull/96) & [#102](https://github.com/kbrw/sweet_xml/pull/102))

## [0.7.4] (2023-08-31)

### Changed

* Contribution from [@thbar](https://github.com/thbar):
  * Logger deprecation warning fixed for Elixir 1.15 (`#94`)
  * Now requires Elixir 1.12+ (`#94`)

## [0.7.3] (2022-04-11)

### Changed

* Handling the option `{:rules, _}` ourselves, as well as partially the option `{:rules, _, _, _}`.
  When nothing is given, a new table is created, and destroyed after.
  If a table is given, and a DTD option is chosen, the table is reused for the DTD handling.
  If a custom `{:rules, _, _, _}` is given, and a restrictive DTD option is chosen, the custome rule will be overridden.
  Because of this mutual exclusivity (reconciling the behaviors is not possible via composition), it is recommended that you handle the DTD
  problem by yourself. You can see the issue `#71` for ideas.
  See the issue `#41` for more details on why this change happened. (Ets leaks.)

## [0.7.2] (2021-11-25)

### Changed

* Improvement on the doc, notably warning that only XPath 1.0 queries are handled.

### Added

* Contribution from [@tank-bohr](https://github.com/github/tank-bohr): Added strict stream API with a more coherent overall behavior, and easier to handle failure behavior:
  `stream!/2` and `stream_tags!/2,3` are now available.

## [0.7.1] (2021-08-25)

### Changed
