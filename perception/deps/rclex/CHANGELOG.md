## v0.10.0 on 19 Mar 2024

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/rclex/rclex/compare/v0.9.3...v0.10.0

**Almost Everything has been breaking changed!!**

According to the knowledge acquired by our R&D experience to date, the internal structure and design of this library have been significantly revised.
The API specification has also been completely redesigned.
From these changes, it is appropriate to say that we have almost reimplemented this library scratch in https://github.com/rclex/rclex/pull/286, leading by the awesome alchemist @pojiro :D

It should be noted that the API in this release is not compatible with v0.9 or earlier, so please be careful when updating this library used in your applications.

We will investigate after this release whether existing [Issues](https://github.com/rclex/rclex/issues) have been resolved by this historical improvement.
