# Changelog

This project does NOT follow semantic versioning. The version increases as
follows:

1. Major version updates are breaking updates to the build infrastructure.
   These should be very rare.
2. Minor version updates are made for every major Buildroot release. This
   may also include Erlang/OTP and Linux kernel updates. These are made four
   times a year shortly after the Buildroot releases.
3. Patch version updates are made for Buildroot minor releases, Erlang/OTP
   releases, and Linux kernel updates. They're also made to fix bugs and add
   features to the build infrastructure.

## v0.9.4

This release bumps Erlang to 24.3.2 and should be a low risk upgrade from the
previous release.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.18.6](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.18.6)

## v0.9.3

This is a Buildroot and Erlang bug and security fix release. It should be a low
risk upgrade from the previous release.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.18.5](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.18.5)

from the previous release.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.18.4](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.18.4)

* Changes
  * Specify CPU-specific flags when compiling NIFs and ports. This fixes an
    issue where some optimizations could not be enabled in NIFs even though it
    should be possible to have them. E.g., ARM NEON support for CPUs that have
    it.

## v0.9.1

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.18.3](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.18.3)

* Changes
  * Programs that use OpenMP will run now. The OpenMP shared library
    (`libgomp.so`) was supplied by the toolchain, but not copied.

## v0.9.0

This release updates to Buildroot 2021.11 and OTP 24.2. If you have made a
custom system, please review the `nerves_system_br` [release
notes](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/blob/v1.18.2/CHANGELOG.md#v1180).

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.18.2](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.18.2)
  * [Buildroot 2021.11](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2021-December/629911.html)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.2](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.2.README)
  * GCC 10.3

* Improvements
  * Support for the `dl.nerves-project.org` backup site. Due to a GitHub outage
    in November, there was a 2 day period of failing builds since some packages
    could not be downloaded. We implemented the backup site to prevent this in
    the future. This update is in the `nerves_defconfig`.
  * Use new build ORB on CircleCI. This ORB will shorten build times to fit in
    CircleCI's new free tier limits. Please update if building your own systems.

## v0.8.3

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.17.4](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.17.4)
  * [Buildroot 2021.08.2](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2021-November/628323.html)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.1.7](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.1.7.README).

## v0.8.2

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.17.3](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.17.3)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.1.4](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.1.4.README).

## v0.8.1

This is a security/bug fix patch release. It should be safe to update for
everyone.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.17.1](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.17.1)
  * [Buildroot 2021.08.1](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2021-October/625642.html)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.1.2](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.1.2.README)

* Improvements
  * Include software versioning and licensing info (see legal-info directory in
    artifact)

## v0.8.0

This release updates to Buildroot 2021.08 and OTP 24.1. If you have made a
custom system off this one, please review the `nerves_system_br v1.17.0` release
notes.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.17.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.17.0)
  * [Buildroot 2021.08](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2021-September/622072.html)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.1](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.1.README)

## v0.7.2

This release updates Erlang/OTP from 24.0.3 to 24.0.5 and Buildroot from 2021.05
to 2021.05.1. Both of these are security/bug fix updates. This is expected to be
a safe upgrade from v1.16.1 for all users.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.16.4](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.16.1)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.0.5](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.0.5.README)

* Improvements
  * Beta support for using a `runtime.exs` script for runtime configuration.
  * Added a `provision` task to the `fwup.config` to enable re-provisioning a
    MicroSD card without changing its contents.
  * Adds a default `/etc/sysctl.conf` that enables use of ICMP in Erlang. This
    requires `nerves_runtime v0.11.5` or later to automatically load the sysctl
    variables. With it using `:gen_udp` to send/receive ICMP will "just work".
    It also makes it easier to add other sysctl variables if needed.

## v0.7.1

This release updates Nerves Toolchains to v1.4.3 and OTP 24.0.3. It should be safe for everyone to apply.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.16.1](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.16.1)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.0.3](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.0.3.README)
  * [nerves toolchains v1.4.3](https://github.com/nerves-project/toolchains/releases/tag/v1.4.3)

## v0.7.0

This release updates to Buildroot 2021.05 and OTP 24.0.2. If you have made a
custom system off this one, please review the `nerves_system_br v1.16.0` release
notes.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.16.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.16.0)
  * [Buildroot 2021.05](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2021-June/311946.html)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.0.2](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.0.2.README)

* Improvements
  * This release now contains debug symbols and includes the Build-ID in the
    ELF headers. This makes it easier to get stack traces from C programs. As
    before, the Nerves tooling strips all symbols from firmware images, so this
    won't make programs bigger.
  * Enable compile-time `wpa_supplicant` options to support WPA3, mesh
    networking, WPS and autoscan.

## v0.6.1

This is a security/bug fix release that updates to Buildroot 2021.02.1 and OTP
23.3.1. It should be safe for everyone to apply.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.15.1](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.15.1)
  * [Buildroot 2021.02](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2021-April/307970.html)
  * [Erlang/OTP 23.3.1](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-23.3.1.README)

## v0.6.0

This release updates to Buildroot 2021.02 and OTP 23.2.7. If you have made a
custom system off this one, please review the `nerves_system_br v1.15.0` release
notes.

The Nerves toolchain has also been updated to v1.4.2. This brings in Linux 4.14
headers to enable use of cdev and eBPF. This won't affect most users.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.15.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.15.0)
  * [Buildroot 2021.02](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2021-March/305168.html)

  * [nerves toolchains v1.4.2](https://github.com/nerves-project/toolchains/releases/tag/v1.4.2)

## v0.5.0

This release updates to Buildroot 2020.11.2, GCC 10.2 and OTP 23.2.4.

When migrating custom systems based, please be aware of the following important
changes:

* There's a new `getrandom` syscall that is made early in BEAM startup. This has
  the potential to block the BEAM before Nerves can start `rngd` to provide
  entropy. We have not seen this issue here, but have updated `erlinit.config`
  for the time being as a precaution.
* The GCC 10.2.0 toolchain has a different name that calls out "nerves" as the
  vendor and the naming is now more consistent with other toolchain providers.
* Experimental support for tooling that requires more information about the
  target has been added. The initial support focuses on zigler.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br: bump to v1.14.4](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.14.4)

## v0.3.2

This release updates to [Buildroot
2020.05.1](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2020-July/287824.html)
and OTP 23.0.3 which are both bug fix releases.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br: bump to v1.12.4](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.12.4)
  * [Erlang/OTP 23.0.3](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-23.0.3.README)
  * [nerves_heart v0.3.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_heart/releases/tag/v0.3.0)

* New features
  * The `/data` directory now exists for storing application-specific data. It
    is currently a symlink to `/root`. Using `/data` will eventually be
    encouraged over `/root` even though currently there is no advantage. This
    change makes it possible to start migrating paths in applications and
    libraries.

* Fixes
  * Fixed old references to the `-Os` compiler flag. All C/C++ code will default
    to using `-O2` now.

## v0.3.1

* Fixes
  * Remove `nerves_system_linter` from hex package. This fixes mix dependency
    errors in projects that reference systems with different
    `nerves_system_linter` dependency specs.

This release updates the system to use Buildroot 2020.05 and Erlang/OTP 23.
