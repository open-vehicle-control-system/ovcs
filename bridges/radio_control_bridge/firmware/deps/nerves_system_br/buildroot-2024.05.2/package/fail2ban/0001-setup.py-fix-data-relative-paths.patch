Subject: [PATCH] setup.py: fix data relative paths
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

As per distutils documentation:

The directory should be a relative path. It is interpreted relative to the
installation prefix (Pythonâ€™s sys.prefix for system installations;
site.USER_BASE for user installations). Distutils allows directory to be an
absolute installation path, but this is discouraged since it is incompatible
with the wheel packaging format [1].

When packaging to a bdist_wheel indeed, the files in the "data_files" dictionary
are not picked at all as data files if they have an absolute path,
but they are instead added to the wheel as python files.
This has the effect of installing them as part of python files in the
site-packages folder when the wheel is installed.

This patch cannot be sent upstream because it breaks the legacy way of
installing the package with *python setup.py install* and it is needed only to
comply with the pep517 buildroot compatibility layer.
