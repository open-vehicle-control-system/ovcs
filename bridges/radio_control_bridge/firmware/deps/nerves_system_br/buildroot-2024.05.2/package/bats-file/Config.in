	  bats-file is a helper library providing common filesystem
	  related assertions and helpers for Bats.

	  Assertions are functions that perform a test and output
	  relevant information on failure to help debugging. They return
	  1 on failure and 0 otherwise. Output, formatted for
	  readability, is sent to the standard error to make assertions
	  usable outside of @test blocks too.
