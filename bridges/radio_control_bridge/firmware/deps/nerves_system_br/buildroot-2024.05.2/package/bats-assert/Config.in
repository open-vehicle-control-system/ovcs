	  bats-assert is a helper library providing common assertions
	  for Bats.

	  In the context of this project, an assertion is a function
	  that perform a test and returns 1 on failure or 0 on success.
	  To make debugging easier, the assertion also outputs relevant
	  information on failure. The output is formatted for
	  readability. To make assertions usable outside of @test
	  blocks, the output is sent to stderr.
