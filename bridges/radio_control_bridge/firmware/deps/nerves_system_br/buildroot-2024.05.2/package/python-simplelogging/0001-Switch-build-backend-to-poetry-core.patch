Subject: [PATCH] Switch build-backend to poetry-core

poetry-core is the lightweight counterpart of poetry that is intended
to be used as a build-backend. Unlike poetry, it does not require
installing all the dependencies of the package manager, making
the builds much faster. The generated artifacts are the same.
